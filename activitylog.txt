Developed a rough plan and submitted proposal. Afterward, spent 1 hr at home uploading a bird list and writing code to sort by length. Spent some time sorting through list for most common birds.

03/24/2022
30 minutes coding to choose a bird from the list, plus 30 minutes coding a CLI for guessBird();

In class - spent 1 hr learning about GUI
At study - 1 hr testing and adding finer details to BirdleGame - validGuess(), cheat code, etc. 
At home - Spent 1 hr at home making the BirdleAlphabet class so that there's a QWERTY display of spaced-out letter buttons

04/10/2022
At home - spent more than 1hr reworking the GUI, Alphabet, and Game files - now the Alphabet can pass information to the Game and back

04/13/2022
In class - spent the hour working on the Display class, adding in buttons

05/09/2022
In class - played around with BirdleDisplay, making it so that a grid was displayed

05/10/2022
In class (1hr) and out of class (1hr)
- Finished BirdleDisplay so that the GridLayout worked
- Edited BirdleAlphabet so it has a private BirdleDisplay that stores information
- Made it so the BirdleDisplay takes in information from BirdleAlphabet about the word and whether it was correct - but not yet able to display that information. 
- Lots of progress today

05/12/2022
In class (1 hr) - editing BirdleDisplay display function to update the game whenever a guess is made, not complete yet but getting there - need to integrate BirdleGUI to have a JPanel that responds to change from the BirdleDisplay class.

05/13/2022
In class (1 hr) - removing BirdleGUI so that BirdleAlphabet carried out its functions, adding spacing in the BirdleDisplay grid, fixing some bugs with the char[][] arrays
Out of class (1 hr) - finishing up the code so that it runs perfectly from the command line, now I need to figure out how to edit a JPanel that's already added to the frame, and then it would be a working demo
GOT A WORKING DEMO

05/23/2022
1 hr in class plus 1 hour outside of class reworking BirdleAlphabet get() method (which makes the keyboard) to be more efficient
HOLY HECK IT WORKS WITH CHANGING THE WORD SIZE
